### Super Tic Tac Toe

The classic game reimagined.

Rules:

The first player starts on the middle board.

When you place down a tile, the next player must play on the board that corresponds to the tile's position.

Once a board has a tic tac toe, that player claims that whole board.

Create a tic tac toe with the boards to win!
